        <h1>To Build A Fire</h1>
        <p>To Build A Fire is a survival game coded on the platform 
           Khan Academy. The premise of the game is that you are stuck
           in the middle of nowhere with nothing, and you need to try
           to keep your health above zero (survival). You can use WASD
            to move, and you can click to harvest items.</p>
        
        <h3>Further Instructions</h3>
        <p>There are things that are out to kill you. Wolves are out to kill
            you by taking your health directly, while rabbits are out to kill
            you by stealing the food that you need. Unfortunately, as of this
            stage, you cannot kill these creatures, but what you <b>can</b> do
            is sprint (SHIFT) to escape animals and to collect berries (which 
            increase your food). <b>Food is important!</b> If you don't have food,
            your health begins decreasing! Make sure your orange food bar stays 
            above zero by collecting berries.</p>
        <p>There are other things you can harvest, like wood and stone. You need a wooden
            pickaxe to harvest stone. Recipes show up as colored squares in the upper-left
            corner. If you hover over them, they reveal the name of their recipe. The ones
            you should care about are <b>fire</b> which increases your health for a short
            period of time, <b>trail mix</b>, made of berries that increase your food, and
            <b>pickaxe</b>, which is used to harvest the stone to build a fire. Good luck!</p>
